# TODO

- [x] Reusable, scalable, modular Javascript code
- [x] Easy to understand, not too complex, and something which can be understood by any other dev.
- [x] Keep your codes short and simple.
- [ ] If using ReactJS framework, set it up from scratch, no boilerplates. Do not use create-react-app.
- [x] Do your code from scratch. We expect you to not use any templates available online.
- [x] Do not use any UI libraries
- [x] When you display good knowledge of JS, we expect you to show equal expertise in SCSS and HTML.
- [x] Use SCSS or css in js not just css.
- [x] Good naming convention for variables, components, and functions
- [x] The template should follow a pixel-perfect approach to the design. We use the PerfectPixel chrome extension to check this.
